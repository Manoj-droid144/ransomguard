        <h2>Understanding Computer Malwares</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>What are Malwares?</h3>
            <p>Malware is a term used to describe a variety of malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
              Malware encompasses a broad range of malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Each type poses unique threats and can cause significant harm to data, privacy, and system stability. Protecting against malware is essential for maintaining cybersecurity.</p>

            <h3>Types of Malwares</h3>
            <p>Some common types of malwares include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Each type has its own method of operation and potential damage.
              Malwares come in various forms, including viruses, which attach themselves to legitimate programs and replicate when executed. Worms spread independently across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities to infect multiple systems. Trojans masquerade as benign software to trick users into installing them, allowing unauthorized access to systems. Ransomware encrypts files or locks users out of their systems until a ransom is paid.
               Spyware covertly monitors user activity, capturing sensitive information without consent.
                Each type presents distinct challenges and requires tailored defense strategies.

            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
            <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files or locks users out of their systems, demanding payment for decryption or access restoration. It typically spreads through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or exploit kits. Once infected, victims may face data loss, financial extortion, or business disruption. Prevention involves regular software updates, robust antivirus protection, and user education on recognizing phishing attempts. 
              In the event of an attack, prompt response, backup restoration, and law enforcement involvement are crucial.</p>
